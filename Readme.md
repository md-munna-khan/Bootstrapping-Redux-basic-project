Welcome to a power-packed module where concepts meet code!



In this stage of your Redux Reaper journey, we’re not just talking theory — we’re building. You’ll solidify your understanding of functional programming, dive into mutation control, and unlock advanced techniques like currying and Redux middleware.



Then we take it further — by combining Redux logic with modern UI tooling using Shadcn UI, React Router, and real-world component architecture. From creating modals, card views, and dark mode, to wiring up the Redux store with selector functions — this is where it all comes together.

By the end of this module, you'll see how clean architecture, functional programming, and scalable state management merge into a professional-grade UI.
